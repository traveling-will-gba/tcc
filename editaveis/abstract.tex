  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

    \textit{Modern games tend to have some performance issues that arenâ€™t noticed due to the great amount of resources available on current platforms. On the other hand, those issues can cause significant impacts to games developed for old platforms. In order to deal with these issues, this work aims to port the game Traveling Will, originally developed for PC, to the portable console Nintendo Game Boy Advance, alongside with the development of a game engine, which will assist the rewriting process. Until the present date, a partial version of this engine, containing input and video modules, and a prototype of the game menu were implemented.}
