  \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

    \textit{Modern games tend to have some performance issues that arenâ€™t noticed due to the great amount of resources available on current platforms. On the other hand, those issues can cause significant impacts to games developed for old platforms. This work aims to port the game Traveling Will, originally developed for PC, to the portable console Nintendo Game Boy Advance. As a final result of this work, the game was succesfully ported to the Game Boy Advance, and contains six playable levels, a main menu and victory and defeat screens, just like the original game.}
