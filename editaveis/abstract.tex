 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

\textit{The massive use of game engines in game development provides many benefits to the game developer in terms of development speed and amount of implemented features. However, when it’s necessary to develop specific features, using such tools ends up on having to add workarounds to the code, which may harm the game performance. For having abundant resources, those performance issues are barely noticed in modern platforms, but they can become a bottleneck in old platforms, which have limited memory and/or storage capacity, or when it’s necessary to use the platform resources to the maximum, like when developing games with robust graphics. In order to test the development of a game in a platform with limited resources when compared to a PC, this work aims to port the game Traveling Will, originally developed for PC, to the portable video game Nintendo Game Boy Advance.}
